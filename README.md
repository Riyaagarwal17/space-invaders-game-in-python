# 🛸 Space Invaders Game 🎮  
_A retro-style arcade game built using Python and Pygame._

## 📖 Overview
Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style game where you control a spaceship to shoot down waves of alien invaders while avoiding their attacks. This project showcases my skills in Python, game development, and implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  

## 🚀 Features
- Smooth and responsive gameplay with real-time collision detection.
- Modular code with 95% OOP principles.
- Optimized event handling for better frame rates.
- Increasing difficulty with progressive levels.
- Real-time score tracking.
